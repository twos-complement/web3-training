# What's next at IndieDAO?

## Level Protocol (v 1.1)

We are currently working on a reputation protocol that will change the game for many DAOs and individuals working between them. We like to call this your "Community Passport", so that you own your own merit and contributions across the many communities you're engaged with. The draft implementation is done, key advisors are being identified, and we are finding pilot DAOs to launch with.

## We're looking for a community manager to help us grow!

Are you someone who loves to help communities feel supported and grow? At IndieDAO, we feel like the core of our success will come from fostering a healthy culture for builders in web3 to push the envelope and work together with respect. IndieDAO will be able to grow into a place to provide sustainable work for Indies if our culture is strong.

If this sounds like you or someone you know, please reach out to us at hello@2c.io

## Web3 Education Course

Within the next couple of weeks, this GitBook will include a new educational course (with dual tracks) for developers and designers looking to level up in their web3 skillsets. Stay tuned.
