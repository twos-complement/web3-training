# Welcome to IndieDAO

## What is IndieDAO?

Being an independent, a ‚Äúfreelancer‚Äù or an ‚ÄúIndie‚Äù, as we like to say, can be risky, challenging, and rewarding. Being responsible for your own business practice grants freedom and flexibility, but also comes with serious drawbacks.

The IndieDAO network picks up responsibility for the mundane, and allows Indies to focus on what they love. Keep the flexibility and independence, but ditch the boring business parts.
